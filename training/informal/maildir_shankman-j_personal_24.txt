Trip was great - did I really describe India as delightful??..perhaps
"intriguing" might have been more appropriate. Hard to miss the headlines -
are you involved at all?  I'll try calling you shortly. I fly back to New
York first thing tomorrow (I missed my flight - traffic on a holiday weekend
here is the worst I have ever witnessed). Hopefully, we'll catch up later
today.
