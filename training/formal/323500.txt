Subject: GARP Credit Derivatives Discussion Group


Vince

We are starting a credit derivatives discussion group in New York.

Is this something you would be interested in?

Like FAS 133 an 800-Call-IN number will be provided for Houston
participants.

Our first meeting will be in a week or so.

Regards,

Philip Merrill
