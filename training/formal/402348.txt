Please review these deal numbers with LADWP to determine if we should be delivering.  Houston lists us as having a $279k MTM position on an index deal (that seems counter intuitive unless we paid up front for some sort of basis swap, or they are gas-indexed). They apparently deliver at Mead 230 and Palo Verde.  Any light that can be shed on these would be helpful.
