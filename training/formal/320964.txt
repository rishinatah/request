Paul,

Thanks for your message. Terry left Enron a few weeks ago after many years with the company.
The best speaker for the occasion you have in mind is Steve Kean, EVP CHIEF OF STAFF, (713) 853-1586
EB 4712 , steve.kean@enron.com .

I shall leave a phone message for Steve about the invitation from you. Can you indicate the subject
of the presentation, or would you like to leave it to him to decide?

Vince
