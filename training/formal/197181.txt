I've taken the oars at trying to revise this list.  Please look over and make 
changes as appropriate.  I've double struck the ones I thought we should 
delete, and have shaded in blue those cells which need to be corrected or 
filled-in.  Please let Kevin know when you've had a chance to review, correct 
and approve.  He can then pass it on to Audrey for final.

I've saved it in the common drive so everyone has a chance to work on it.  
It's at the following address:

Subject: Christmas List

Please find attached the revised copy of the Christmast Card List.  I will be 
working on this list tomorrow and ask that you review.  

I have combined all of the lists and deleted duplicates.  Make sure that the 
persons and companies listed are updated.

Thanks in advance,
