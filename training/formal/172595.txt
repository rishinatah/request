Gentlemen:

	Jim Fallon has asked that I arrange a meeting tomorrow to discuss the potential bankruptcy proceedings regarding Enron Canada Corp.  With the board meeting, tomorrow seems to be a particularly busy day.  I am suggesting that 10:30 am be the meeting time.  I will arrange a room near the 50th Floor and, hopefully, we can get together.  At that point we can call Canada and discuss this matter.  Let me know if you have different thoughts or cannot attend.
