I'm glad to know that she is home.  I can just imagine how much fun those 
oxygen treatments will be!  I know that you will be thankful to have your 
whole family under the same roof.  --Sally

Olivia came home this afternoon at 4pm.

Hopefully much better.

She'll have the oxygen treatment every 2 hours off some massive & complicated 
contraption.
