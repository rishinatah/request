Jacques,

Here is Larry Lewter's response to my request for more documentation to 
support the $15,000.  As you will read below, it is no longer an issue.  I 
think that was the last issue to resolve.

Phillip, the title company held the $15,000 in escrow and it has been
returned. It is no longer and issue.
