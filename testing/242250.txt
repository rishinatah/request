You and Tony are welcome to join us.  We are meeting in EB4262 tomorrow at 
10:00 am.  We've had a similar request from Lee Ferrell, which we would also 
expect to honor.  Please let us know when you'd like to talk prior to the 
meeting.

Subject: Risk Management

I noted in the Finance and Accounting report that you guys are setting up a 
meeting with AA to talk about the draft risk management document that folks 
had been working on a year ago.  Please include Tony and I.   We had some 
questions and concerns that I have long since forgotten but will renew and 
talk to you about before the AA meeting.  Thanks. DF
