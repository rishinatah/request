You're so right! I checked around and found that Arizona Public Service still 
does the transmission deals for Pinnacle West. I'll change both deals right 
away.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I think the above deals should be in as Arizona Public Service since 
they are transmission deals.  Let me know what you find out.

Thanks alot,
Melissa
